Let’s create a tool that counts the number of words or lines provided as input
using the standard input (STDIN) connection. By default, this tool will count
the number of words, unless it receives the -l flag, in which case it’ll count the
number of lines instead.

We’ll start by creating the basic implementation. This version reads data from
STDIN and displays the number of words.
